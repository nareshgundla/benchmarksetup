# Installation of Apache Hadoop using ansible role

This roles helps in installing Apache Hadoop on all the client and master nodes,
creates required  directories for both Hdfs and Yarn and 
configures the tunings based on the cluster size


## Getting Started
 * Validate your cluster information(optional)
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags config_check

for every node it prints the config used:
    - "HDFS NAME DIR"
    - "HDFS CHKPT DIR"
    - "DRIVES LIST"
    - "HDFS DATA DIR"
    - "YARN DATA DIR"
    - "HDFS DATA DIR SUFFIX:"
    - "Slaves::"
    - " NUMBER OF NODES : "
    - "REPLICATION FACTOR : "
```
 * Run the Ansible Role
 ```
 ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags hadoop
 
 Sample playbook.yml file:
 - name: Setup Hadoop
   vars_files: hadoop_variable.yml
   hosts: cluster-hosts
   remote_user:root
   roles:
   - { role: hadoop, tags:hadoop }
 ```

## Assumptions
 * Assumes all External Drives are formatted in ext4 format.
 * ignores boot drive for HDFS/YARN directoires if node contains any external drives.
 
 Note: HADOOP_MASTER: node name should be with domain name

## Configuration
Default Hadoop Tunings are set in defaults/main.yml
 * Hadoop Name Node and Secondary Name node heap size 
 ```
	HADOOP_HDFS_NN_SN_HEAPSIZE_MB: 1024
 ```
 * Yarn Memory Allocation Percentage:
```
	YARN_MEM_RESOURCE_PERCENTATION: 0.92
 ```
 * Cores reserverd for Operative system and other services (if you are running any other services then allocate more vcores below)
```
	CORES_FOR_OS: 3   
```
 * Yarn Disk allocation percentage for application temporary Storage.
```
	YARN_DISK_PERCENTAGE_UTILIZATION: 90
```
 * Yarn Node Manager Heap Size (10GB will be sufficient for upto 100TB Dataset)
```
	YARN_NODEMANAGER_HEAPSIZE_MB: 10240
```
 * If you have already copied the Hadoop tar file to the destination then "yes"
```
	REMOTE_HADOOP_SRC: no
```
 * To enable Spark Dynamic Execution {possible values yes,no}
```
	SPARK_DYNAMIC_EXECUTION: no
```
 * To Enable/Aadd -XX:+UseLargePages flag to JVM params for hadoop services {possible values yes,no}
```
	USE_NR_HUGEPAGES: no 
```
 * To Save Yarn container logs for debugging then enable below flag  {possible values true,false}
```
	YARN_LOG_ENABLE: false
```
